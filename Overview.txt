Implementation Steps (Ordered)
Step 1: Foundation - Theme, Firebase, Layout
Files: globals.css, lib/firebase.ts, lib/firestore.ts, lib/types.ts, app/layout.tsx

Update globals.css with dark futuristic color tokens (neon cyan/purple accents on deep black)
Create lib/firebase.ts - Initialize Firebase app, export db (Firestore), storage, auth
Create lib/firestore.ts - Generic CRUD helpers: getDoc, getDocs, setDoc, updateDoc, deleteDoc, uploadFile
Create lib/types.ts - Define all TypeScript interfaces:

HeroData, AboutData, EducationItem, ExperienceItem, SkillCategory, ProjectItem, CertificationItem, MedalItem, ContactData, ChatContext


Update app/layout.tsx with metadata for "Satyam Chandra | Portfolio", dark class, Inter/Geist font

Step 2: Main Portfolio Page - All Sections
Files: app/page.tsx, all components/portfolio/*.tsx
Build the single-page portfolio with all sections. Each section reads data from Firestore with fallback placeholder data (so the site works even before CMS data exists).
Sections in order:

Navbar - Floating glassmorphism nav, sticky, with section links + glow underline on active
Hero - Full viewport, animated text reveal with Framer Motion, 3D React Three Fiber canvas with floating geometric shapes (icosahedron, torus knot, octahedron) that rotate and react to mouse. Neon cyan glow. CTA buttons.
About - Split layout: text left, decorative right. Stagger-in animations on scroll.
Education - Vertical timeline with glowing line and cards that slide in.
Experience - Similar timeline/card layout with tech stack badges.
Skills - Categorized grid with animated progress bars/rings. Glow on fill.
Projects - Card grid with 3D tilt on hover (CSS perspective transform)3D Parallax Tilt Effect combined with Glassmorphism.. Image, title, description, tech stack tags, links. Cards have neon border glow.
Medals/Badges - Dedicated section with 3D spinning coins rendered via R3F. Each medal shows platform icon, achievement text. Hover to spin faster.
Certifications - Card grid similar to projects(3D Parallax Tilt Effect combined with Glassmorphism).
Contact - Form + social links. Glowing submit button.
Footer - Minimal with social links.

Animation strategy:

Each section uses Framer Motion motion.div with whileInView for scroll-triggered reveals
Staggered children animations using variants with staggerChildren
3D tilt on cards via onMouseMove calculating rotateX/rotateY with CSS perspective
Hero 3D scene lazy-loaded with dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })

Step 3: 3D Components (React Three Fiber)
Files: components/three/hero-scene.tsx, components/three/medal-coin.tsx, components/three/floating-particles.tsx

Hero Scene: Canvas with floating geometric meshes (Icosahedron, TorusKnot, Octahedron) using drei. Neon wireframe material with cyan/purple emissive. Mouse-follow rotation via useFrame. Environment lighting set to "night" preset.
Medal Coin: A cylinder geometry with text on faces. Shiny metallic material. Auto-rotation with speed boost on hover. Wrapped in Html overlay for labels.
Floating Particles: Instanced mesh with many small spheres drifting slowly. Adds ambient depth.

Step 4: AI Chatbot
Files: app/api/chat/route.ts, components/chatbot/chat-widget.tsx, components/chatbot/chat-messages.tsx

API Route: POST handler that takes messages array, prepends system prompt with user's context document (stored in Firestore settings/chatbot), calls Google Gemini API (generativelanguage.googleapis.com), streams response back.
Chat Widget: Floating button (bottom-right) with neon glow pulse. Opens a slide-up chat panel with glassmorphism styling. Input field + message list. Uses fetch to stream responses.
Chat Messages: Renders user/AI messages with different styling. Typing indicator with animated dots.

Step 5: Admin Panel - Auth + Layout
Files: app/admin/login/page.tsx, app/admin/layout.tsx, components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx, components/admin/auth-guard.tsx

Login Page: Email/password form using Firebase Auth signInWithEmailAndPassword. Clean dark UI.
Auth Guard: Client component that checks onAuthStateChanged. Redirects to login if not authenticated.
Admin Layout: Sidebar navigation to all editable sections. Uses shadcn Sidebar component. Protected by Auth Guard.
Dashboard: Overview page showing quick stats (number of projects, skills, etc.)

Step 6: Admin CRUD Pages
Files: app/api/admin/[collection]/route.ts, all app/admin/*/page.tsx, components/admin/crud-form.tsx, components/admin/media-upload.tsx

Generic API: Dynamic route that handles GET/POST/PUT/DELETE for any Firestore collection.
CRUD Form: Reusable form component that takes a field schema and renders appropriate inputs (text, textarea, image upload, array of tags, etc.)
Media Upload: Component that uploads files to Firebase Storage, returns the download URL.
Per-section admin pages: Each section gets a page with:

List view (table) of existing items
Add/Edit dialog with the CRUD form
Delete confirmation
Drag-to-reorder (for ordering items)
For singleton data (Hero, About, Contact): direct edit form instead of list



Firestore Collections Schema
hero/main          - { title, subtitle, description, ctaText, ctaLink }
about/main         - { bio, details: [...], imageUrl }
education/[id]     - { institution, degree, period, description, order }
experience/[id]    - { company, role, period, description, techStack: [...], order }
skills/[id]        - { category, items: [{ name, proficiency }], order }
projects/[id]      - { title, description, techStack: [...], imageUrl, liveUrl, githubUrl, featured, order }
certifications/[id] - { title, issuer, date, credentialUrl, imageUrl, order }
medals/[id]        - { platform, achievement, description, iconUrl, color, order }
contact/main       - { email, phone, location, socials: { github, linkedin, twitter, ... } }
settings/chatbot   - { contextDocument, systemPrompt, enabled }

Key Design Decisions

Single-page portfolio - All sections on one page with smooth scroll navigation (better UX for portfolios)
Server-side data fetching - Portfolio page uses server components to fetch Firestore data, with revalidate for ISR
Client-side 3D - All R3F components are client-only with dynamic import + ssr: false
Fallback data - Every section has hardcoded placeholder data so the site works before any CMS data is added
Admin is fully client-side - Admin panel uses client components with Firebase SDK directly (no server actions needed)
Gemini streaming - Chat API streams responses for real-time feel
No Lenis - Using native smooth scroll + Framer Motion scroll animations (avoids extra bundle + complexity)
